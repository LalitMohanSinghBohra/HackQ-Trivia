### Bearer token
It can be found by sniffing the traffic on your phone. The bearer token is easily found on an emulator, since they are easy to root and most use Android versions without certificate pinning. Popular tools used to obtain bearer tokens are Charles, Fiddler, and Burp Suite.
 
Paste your bearer token after `Bearer` in `hq_config.conf`, all within one line.
